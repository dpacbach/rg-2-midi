# rg-2-midi
CLI tool for exporting Rosegarden files to MIDI files.

The code in this repository is taken from the Rosegarden project:

  https://www.rosegardenmusic.com/

The Rosegarden project is an open-source GPLv2-licensed project,
hence this project is also GPLv2, including the new code added to
it that was not taken from Rosegarden.

Rg-2-midi was created by lifting out a subset of code files from
Rosegarden that were needed to support the reading of .rg files
and the exporting of MIDI files, then gluing them to together
with a small bit of code in `main.cpp`.
